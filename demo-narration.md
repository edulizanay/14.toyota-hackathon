# Demo Narration (2:30)

## 1. Hook - The Racing Problem (15s)
- "What separates podium finishers from the rest of the pack?"
- "We analyzed 16 drivers and 4,879 brake events from Barber Motorsports Park to find out"
- **Show**: Title slide or track overview

## 2. The Discovery - What Winners Do (30s)
- "Three insights changed everything:"
- **Winners brake earlier and softer**: 26m earlier, 23% less pressure—more time to settle the car
- **Consistency where it matters**: 7m tighter in the final complex and infield entry—the zones where races are won
- **Strategic variation**: Winners vary 29m in some zones—intentional optimization, not random scatter
- "Consistency isn't everywhere—it's precision where it counts"
- **Show**: Dashboard preview with Zone 5 & 8 highlighted

## 3. The Tool - Live Demo (70s)
- "Here's every brake point at Barber, plotted by GPS"
- **Click winner**: "Notice the tight clusters in Zones 5 and 8—textbook consistency"
- **Click mid-pack driver**: "See the scatter? 7+ meters of variation in the same zones"
- **Toggle centroids**: "Average brake points vs. lap-by-lap detail"
- **Point to chart**: "Dispersion tells drivers exactly where to focus practice time"
- "This is what separates champions from fast drivers—measurable, actionable precision"
- **Show**: Live dashboard interaction, winner vs. field comparison, toggle feature

## 4. How It Works (20s)
- "Built on official Toyota GR Cup telemetry plus USAC timing data"
- "GPS brake onset detection, then zone discovery from actual brake clusters—not predefined corners"
- "We found where drivers actually brake, not where the track map says they should"
- **Show**: Brief methodology diagram or code snippet

## 5. Impact (20s)
- "Drivers see exactly which zones need work"
- "Coaches prioritize limited track time on what matters most"
- "Teams distinguish technique issues from intentional line variation"
- "Future: real-time feedback during sessions—building muscle memory faster"
- **Show**: Use case scenarios

## 6. Close (5s)
- "Try it live: [GitHub Pages URL]"
- "Transforming gut feeling into measurable improvement"
- **Show**: Live demo URL on screen

## Key Talking Points

**Lead with impact, not features:**
- ✅ "Winners brake 26m earlier and use 23% less pressure"
- ❌ "Our tool detects brake onset using GPS coordinates"

**Show, don't tell:**
- ✅ Click drivers, show the visual difference
- ❌ Explain how the algorithm works

**Make it actionable:**
- ✅ "This tells you which zones to practice"
- ❌ "This is an interesting data visualization"

**Future vision:**
- ✅ "Real-time feedback during practice sessions"
- ❌ "We could add more features someday"
