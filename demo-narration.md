# Demo Narration (60 seconds)

## Hook (10s)
- "Consistency separates fast drivers from champions—but how do you measure it? Introducing Brake Point Drift Detector."

## Show the viz (20s)
- "Using GR Cup telemetry from Barber, we visualized every brake point as GPS coordinates on the track"
- "Gray dots = fastest driver's brake points (notice how tight). Colored dots = mid-pack driver. Green = consistent, red = scattered"
- "Right panel shows dispersion at each corner in meters"

## The insight (15s)
- "Corner 5: this driver's brake points scattered across 8 meters, fastest driver within 2 meters"
- "This is repeatability—first step to improvement. Tight clusters means you're doing the same thing every lap, scattered means something's changing"
- "Can't fix what you can't repeat"

## Impact & future (15s)
- "Select any driver, instantly see where to focus practice time"
- "Future: real-time audio feedback—'braked 3 meters early, Corner 5'—building muscle memory faster"
- "For GR Cup teams with limited track time, this prioritizes development efforts"

## Key Messages

### What the tool shows
- **Repeatability, not correctness**: Tight clusters mean consistent behavior; scattered means something varies lap-to-lap
- **First step to improvement**: You can't fix what you can't repeat
- **Prioritization**: Shows which corners need attention first

### What it doesn't claim
- Not prescriptive about HOW to brake
- Not claiming "match these coordinates" (racing line context matters)
- Shows symptom (inconsistency) not necessarily root cause (could be line, braking, or both)

### Future vision
- Real-time audio feedback during laps
- Building muscle memory faster through immediate feedback
- Extends from post-session analysis to in-session coaching
