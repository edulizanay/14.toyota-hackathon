# ABOUTME: Legacy dashboard prototypes kept for reference
# ABOUTME: These are not actively maintained - use dashboards.py for current implementations

"""
Legacy visualization prototypes.

These functions are early prototypes that explored different UI patterns:
- plot_reference_driver: Static reference driver view with gray brake clusters
- create_interactive_dashboard: Dropdown-based driver comparison

The current implementation (create_zone_focused_dashboard) uses zone pills
and keyboard navigation which proved more usable.

These are preserved as examples but not actively maintained. If you need them,
they would need to be updated to use the new module structure:
- Import from .track_outline instead of local functions
- Import from .dashboards for ZONE_COLORS constant
- Update paths to use parameters instead of module constants

# Original implementations removed to reduce maintenance burden
# See git history (deliverables/src/visuals.py prior to refactor) if needed
